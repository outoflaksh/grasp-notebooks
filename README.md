<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Grasp provides a unique and easier way to write and learn SQL. It's like Jupyter notebooks except that you can run SQL queries as code blocks. With Grasp, we wanted to create a coding notebook-like experience but for executing SQL. The main goal was to make it easy for people to learn SQL, by providing the ability to:

1. Save the queries and their results.
2. Share notebooks so that others can view them.
3. Add Markdown documentation in between code blocks to provide context.

Grasp provides ways to accomplish all that! Here's what a typical Grasp notebook looks like:

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Set up your Planetscale database and add `DATABASE_URL` in a `.env` file in the root directory. Also generate a SECRET_KEY for JWT auth. You can use the    following command:
   ```sh
   openssl rand -hex 32
   ```
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/outoflaksh/grasp-notebooks.git
   ```
3. Install the Python dependencies using Pipenv or the `requirements.txt` file. 
   ```sh
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   OR
   pip3 install pipenv
   pipenv install
   pipenv shell
   ```
   Then, run the FastAPI server with Uvicorn.
   ```sh
   uvicorn api.main:app
   ```
4. Install dependencies for the React frontend.
   ```sh
   cd frontend && npm install
   ```
5. Run the React server.
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
